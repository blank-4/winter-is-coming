# \_blank's Winter Holidays project

## What ?

You will have to create an _e-CV_ or _e-Portfolio_.

It is a website destined to professionals and potential recruiters/employers, and available on the Web.

More detailed instructions are available in the "Specs" section.

Improving your project beyond instructions will be greatly appreciated and rewarded with Bonus Points.

## Why ?

This assigment has been created to test all the knowledge and skills you acquired during \_blank's first modules (up to the lesson on Timers/AJAX).

Keep in mind that this website will be a useful tool for an internship or job search.

## When ?

You can start working on your project as soon as these instructions are available to you.
The deadline for this project is on the 06/01/2019 23:59:59.

## How ?

The expected work must be on a GitHub repository in your personal account.
It must be available as a [GitHub Pages website](https://pages.github.com/), i.e. visible at [http://\<your-username\>.github.io](http://\<your-username\>.github.io).

We will review the code and aspect of the website for the last commit preceding the deadline.


### Seeking help
